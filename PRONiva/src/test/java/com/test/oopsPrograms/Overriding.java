		// Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
		// Method overriding is nothing but a declaration of same method in
		// child and parent class with same parameter with same return type

		// Overriding is required when we want different implementation than
		// parent method
		// Rules for Java Method Overriding
		// The method must have the same name as in the parent class
		// The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
		// There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

		// IMPORTANT
		// Can we override static method?
		// No, a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime
		// polymorphism, so we will learn it later.
		//
		// Why can we not override static method?
		// It is because the static method is bound with class whereas instance
		// method is bound with an object. Static belongs to the class area, and
		// an instance belongs to the heap area.
		//
		// Can we override java main method?
		// No, because the main is a static method.
